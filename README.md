# WriteIt
A simple Speech-To-text (STT) interface for the web browser

All you have to do is download it and run it in your browser.
+ If run locally, it eill constantly request you to allow access to the microphone. 
It's a bit annoying and it's a bug in the browser. 

Allthough, this one is a bit tricky as it's a better experience on a server.
+ Firefox based do not support this feature at all.
+ Better to run on Chrome/Edge(1st).
